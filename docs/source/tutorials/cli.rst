Database Manipulation
---------------------
The Dex-Net CLI includes functionality for opening, reading, and writing HDF5 databases of 3D object models, parallel-jaw grasps, and grasp robustness metrics.

The `tutorial`_ walks through the Dex-Net Command Line Interface `dexnet_cli.py`_ which is included in the `dex-net` repository under the apps/ directory.
The tutorial is hosted `on Google Docs`_ with support for comments to help us improve it.
